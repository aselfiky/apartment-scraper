# apartment-scraper

Apartment Scraper is a tool that I wrote for scraping listings from an apartment community and the tool checks to see if there are any new listings. If there are new listings then I send myself an email notification with the new data, so that I can check and see if the apartment floor plan I'm looking for is available.

This tool can be applied in many other ways such as checking a retail website for item prices, item availability, etc.
